            Art is not what you see, but what you make others see 
            .Hey there! this is Samya.I'm a student of class 
            10<SUP>th</SUP>.I'm 15 years old.One of my hobbies is 
            sketching and of course I'm very passionate about it.The 
            best thing 
            in Art is Art speaks where words are unable to explain.
            <B>I'm gonna tell you some basic rules that will help you 
            to make attractive sketches.

         <UL>
         <I>BASICS</I>
         <LI>Use 2b pencil while sketching and 6b while blending </LI>
         <LI>Make sure that you do not draw so dark that it gets 
         very hard to rub.
         </LI>
         <LI>Do shading with blenders rather than using direct 
         pencil (increases realism in your sketch)
         <LI>Stay calm while sketching</LI></B>
         </UL>
         <p>These were some basic key features that you must keep in 
            mind everytime while painting.
